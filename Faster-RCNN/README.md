## Apply Faster RCNN on WSAD

Our work is based [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/master/detectron2) platform, and you need to install Detectron2 first.

Putting the WSAD dataset under the "data" folder and keep the config file the right position, then you can just run the codes above for training and testing. (Please check the output folder and the dataset path)



It's worth noting that the environment we used is:

- Ubuntu16.04

- GTX1080TI * 2



So you may check the GPU numbers first before running.
